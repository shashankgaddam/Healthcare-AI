# The aim of this project is to detect and localize brain tumours based on the Brain MRI scans.

# We have been provided with 3929 Brain MRI scans along with their brain tumour location.

# This project is mainly divided into two parts.

# 1. Classification using RESNET
# This model classifies if the given image of the MRI scan contains tumour or not.

# 2. Segmentation using RESUNET
# This model localizes/detects the area in the Brain MRI where the tumour has formed.
